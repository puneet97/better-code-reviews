    Most developers have heard that peer code reviews can do wonders to a codebase.<br><br>But not <i>all</i> types of code reviews are effective.<br><br>Some code reviews seem to go on and on forever, while others pick at syntax and formatting, but miss major bugs that somehow end up in production!</p>

      <p class="quote">We have one dev who just blindly thumbs-up every PR and rarely leaves comments. That person is attempting to game the rule of ‚Äúat least two approvals‚Äù. It is easy to tell, because inside of one minute they will suddenly have approved 5‚Äì6 PRs. I would fire this person for this alone were it in my power.</p>

      <p class="quote">I find that the 2nd or 3rd reviewer is often more likely to rubber stamp after seeing one approval. Perhaps blind reviews (minus comments left?) could be helpful?</p>

      <p class="quote">Everyone on the team should receive equal review. I feel like it‚Äôs so common for senior people to get no feedback because people assume they can do no wrong but they totally can, and might want feedback.

      <p class="quote">I take any feedback on PR's at face value. If changing that string to a symbol will make you happy, let‚Äôs do that and move on. I‚Äôm not going to try and justify an arbitrary decision. It‚Äôs not unlike working in an IDE environment, it‚Äôs very easy for my brain to fall into a ‚Äúsee red squiggle, fix red squiggle‚Äù mindset. I don‚Äôt really care why it‚Äôs upset, just make it stop yelling at me.<br><br> This makes me sad. The best parts of any system I‚Äôve worked on were the result of someone questioning an assumption and starting a conversation. Face-to-face this takes minutes from thought to alternative implementation. But with a PR, I don‚Äôt know if you agree with me in the first place, so I don‚Äôt know if I should build on that thought. And if we start a back-and-forth‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI start to get antsy about getting to ‚Äúdone‚Äù.</p>

      <p class="quote">People need to do better jobs distinguishing between their own stylistic preferences and feedback that makes a functional difference. It can be tough for a more junior person to figure out which is which. It‚Äôs also frustrating when multiple seniors give conflicting feedback (e.g. What to call a route and why).</p>

      <p class="quote">It can be difficult to gauge the appropriate level of brutality in a comment. I don‚Äôt want to blow minor nitpicks out of proportion, and I don‚Äôt want to put the submitter on the defensive even when something‚Äôs badly wrong since that makes it harder to actually get the job done.</p>

      <p class="quote">I feel pretty strongly that it‚Äôs annoying when people demand changes, especially if they don‚Äôt take the time to explain why they‚Äôre doing so, or leave room for the possibility that they‚Äôre wrong. Especially when people just rewrite your code in a comment and tell you to change to their version.</p>

      <p class="quote">One problem we have is that we want to be rigorous about things like coding standards, but it becomes frustrating for the author of a patch if they have to change too many things. Most of the time it‚Äôs easier to mention a few of the most important fixes for one review, and fix the other things later. Most of our disagreements during code reviews are about how to name things.</p>

        Ego vs. Empathy

      <p class="quote">Code reviews work best when everyone is already pulling in the same direction, wants one another to succeed, and everyone is subject to the same rules. They go bad when submitters push bad code expecting it to be fixed in review. They go bad when reviewers demand changes to non-broken code just because it wasn‚Äôt written how they personally would have done it. They go bad when there are multiple reviewers coming in at different times, requiring many re-submissions. They go bad when one reviewer leaves some comments, and then leaves some completely unrelated comments only after the first lot were already addressed. They go bad when people aren‚Äôt nice to each other.</p>
